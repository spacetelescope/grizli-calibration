We examine each order fringe from the grism filters G102 and G141 and how they compare with the CDBS

\ssectionstar{Introduction}
\normalsize{

WFC3 (Wide Field Camera 3) has grisms (a grating and prism combination used for spectroscopy) 
for the UVIS and IR channels. In the IR, much work has gone into precisely calibrating the
grisms (G102 and G141). Specifically, \texttt{grizli} -- an open source reduction suite (Brammer?)
was created to extract grism observations and produce the high quality slitless spectroscopy with
WFC3. However, \texttt{grizli} depends not only on accurate extraction of flux but also on aligning
the extraction with the observation. With this project we aimed to extract two sets of WFC3/IR grism
observations of GD-71 and GD-153 and compare the WFC3 slitless spectroscopy to the exisiting spectroscopy
both from STIS (the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph) and the X-Shooting Spectral Library. 

% Example figure -- this is obvi leftover from an old ISR but I like keeping some ex formatting around.

\ssectionstar{Data}
\normalsize{

We began with two data sets on GD-71 and GD-153. Both utilized both IR grisms (G102 and G141) and had matching direct
observations in at least F105 and F140 repsectively, and some with additional matching direct filters F... and F...
